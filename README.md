## Week 01
On our first week we had to develop the Figma prototype of the landing page for MegaRocket GYM SA. a gym brand.
The first instance of the project was a group activity, me and my partner Ignacio Galcer√°n were in charge of the design.
We base the construction of it following the example given by the tutors and the weekly planning. We use the resources and components available in the UI-Kit (a pre-designed Figma file), we also include fonts, icons and images to reach the final result.
It was our first experience using Figma, it was a challenge that we managed to carry out working as a team with good communication.

### **Development steps**

## Week 02
This week the work mode was individual. I started by reviewing the documentation and intensively reading the week planning.
Then progressively I was creating the HTML file, first making the basic structure and then adding the necessary components, always thinking about creating a semantic structure that facilitates accessibility and SEO. 
This landing page has a header, a side navigation bar, a main, and several content sections within it, also has a contact form and a footer.
The purpose is to start shaping the prototype of the landin page developed in week 01.

### **Structure components**

## Week 03
We started making corrections in the HTML file and reviewing the documentation and the tasks to be developed, this week it was time to implement the styles in CSS.
It's a new structure, we begin to see the visual changes in our landing, the page that we have been working on since the first week begins to take shape.
The weekly objective is to create a static design, understand the use of classes, properties and their attributes, also to understand the connection between files.
The task is to work with CSS styles, have to name the classes correctly, avoid the excessive use of properties such a position absolute and relative. Also can not use flexbox and grid and the measure unit used in the project should be only pixels.

### **Styles properties**

This are the most important properties used in the project and how they should be applied to the page.

<details><summary>CLICK ME</summary>

<p>

1. `Box Model Properties:`
These properties include "width", "height", "padding", "border", and "margin". They control the size, spacing, and borders of HTML elements on the page.

 `Width and Height:`
The "width" and "height" properties are used to set the dimensions of an HTML element. For example, if you want to set the width of a div element to 300 pixels and the height to 200 pixels, you would write:

```
div {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
}
```

`Padding:`
The "padding" property is used to define the space between the content of an HTML element and its border. For example, if you want to add 20 pixels of padding to a div element, you would write:

```
div {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

`Border:`
The "border" property is used to define the border of an HTML element. It consists of three parts: border-width, border-style, and border-color. For example, if you want to add a 2 pixel solid black border to a div element, you would write:

```
div {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

`Margin:`
The "margin" property is used to define the space between an HTML element and its neighboring elements. For example, if you want to add 10 pixels of margin to the top and bottom of a div element, you would write:

```
div {
  margin-top: 10px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```

2. `Display Property:`
This property control how HTML elements are displayed on a web page. For example, you can use the "display" property to control whether an element is treated as a block or inline element.

`Block:`
The "block" value is used to display an HTML element as a block-level element. Block-level elements take up the full width of their container and start on a new line. Examples of block-level elements include div, h1, p, and ul. For example, to make a div element display as a block element, you would write:

```
div {
  display: block;
}
```

`Inline:`
The "inline" value is used to display an HTML element as an inline-level element. Inline-level elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary to display their content. Examples of inline-level elements include span, a, and img. For example, to make a span element display as an inline element, you would write:

```
span {
  display: inline;
}
```

`Inline-Block:`
The "inline-block" value is used to display an HTML element as an inline-level block container. Inline-block elements do not start on a new line and take up as much width as necessary to display their content, while still allowing for the setting of height and width. Examples of inline-block elements include button and input. For example, to make a button element display as an inline-block element, you would write:

```
button {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

3. `Font Properties:`
These properties control the font family, size, style, and weight of text in HTML elements. They include "font-family", "font-size" and "font-weight".

`Font-family:`
The "font-family" property is used to define the font family for text on a web page. It specifies a list of font family names and/or generic family names to use for an element. For example, to set the font family of all paragraphs to Arial and Helvetica, you would write:

```
p {
  font-family: "Arial", "Helvetica", sans-serif;
}
```

`Font-size:`
The "font-size" property is used to define the font size for text on a web page. It specifies the size of the font in pixels, ems, or other length units. For example, to set the font size of all paragraphs to 16 pixels, you would write:

```
p {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

`Font-weight:`
The "font-weight" property is used to define the font weight for text on a web page. It specifies whether the text should be bold, normal, or lighter. For example, to set the font weight of all paragraph text to bold, you would write:

```
p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

4. `Color Properties:`
These properties control the color of text, backgrounds, and borders in HTML elements. They include "color", "background-color", and "border-color".

`Color:`
The "color" property is used to define the text color for an element. It specifies the color of the text in terms of a named color, a hexadecimal value, an RGB value, or an HSL value. For example, to set the text color of all paragraphs to red, you would write:
```
p {
  color: red;
}
```

`Background-color:`
The "background-color" property is used to define the background color of an element. It specifies the color of the background in terms of a named color, a hexadecimal value, an RGB value, or an HSL value. For example, to set the background color of a div element to light blue, you would write:
```
div {
  background-color: #ADD8E6;
}
```

`Border-color:`
The "border-color" property is used to define the color of the border around an element. It specifies the color of the border in terms of a named color, a hexadecimal value, an RGB value, or an HSL value. For example, to set the border color of a div element to black, you would write:
```
div {
  border-color: black;
}
```

5. `Positioning Properties:`
These properties control the position of HTML elements on a web page. They include "position", "top", "right", "bottom", and "left". For example, you can use the "position" property to control whether an element is positioned relatively or absolutely.

`Position: Relative`
The "position: relative" property is used to position an element relative to its normal position on the web page. It allows you to use the top, bottom, left, and right properties to adjust the position of the element. For example, to move a paragraph element 10 pixels to the right and 20 pixels down, you would write:

```
p {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
  left: 10px;
}
```

`Position: Absolute`
The "position: absolute" property is used to position an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor or to the initial containing block if no positioned ancestor exists. It also allows you to use the top, bottom, left, and right properties to adjust the position of the element. For example, to position a div element 50 pixels from the top and 100 pixels from the left of its containing block, you would write:
```
div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 100px;
}
```
