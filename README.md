# Become a Software Professional 2023

## Week 01
On week 01 we had to develop the Figma prototype of the landing page.
The first instance of the project was a group activity, me and my partner Ignacio Galcerán were in charge of the design.
We base the construction of it following the example given by the tutors and the weekly planning. We also use the resources and components available in the UI-Kit, we also include fonts, icons and images to reach the final result.
It was our first experience using Figma, it was a challenge that we managed to carry out working as a team with good communication.

## Week 02
This week the work mode was individual. I started by reviewing the documentation and intensively reading the weekly planning.
Then progressively I was creating the HTML file, first making the basic structure and then adding the necessary components. This landing page has a header, a side navigation bar, a main, and several content sections within it, also has a contact form and a footer.
The purpose is to start shaping the prototype of the landin page developed in week 01.
