## Week 01
On our first week we had to develop the Figma prototype of the landing page for MegaRocket GYM SA. a gym brand.
The first instance of the project was a group activity, me and my partner Ignacio Galcerán were in charge of the design.
We base the construction of it following the example given by the tutors and the weekly planning. We use the resources and components available in the UI-Kit (a pre-designed Figma file), we also include fonts, icons and images to reach the final result.
It was our first experience using Figma, it was a challenge that we managed to carry out working as a team with good communication.

### **Development steps**

1. Started by choosing the desktop frame, the color pallet and some pre-designed componentes as buttons and fonts.
2. Stablish the basic important sections: Header, sidebar, main and a footer.
3. The header will include only the Logo (available on the UI-Kit).
4. The sidebar will be made up of the link sections: Home, Sing Up, Login and Contact. The Contact will display another section with the contact options: an email, a phone number and an adress, along with the corresponding icons. Is gonna be displayed in the left side of the screen.
5. The main section will be composed of a title, a subtitle, an explanatory text and an image that will occupy a large part of the page.
6. Before the footer, we will add another sections: Meet us, Contact us, About us and a gym activities section, every of this sections will occupy a screen frame an be separate one another with a line between them.
7. Section Meet us: Has a title and it's divided into 4 sub-sections that explain the information offered within the page where clients would be able to understand what this company is up to. We also use images/icons that identify every sub-section so as titles and a brief descriptive text.
8. Section Contact us: Starts with a title (this is repeated in every section) Here we will make a contact form, which will have different inputs: name, last name, email, a checkbox options to choose the motive of the consulting, and a text field to write a message. Finally counts with 2 buttons, one for sending and one for resetting.
9. Section About us: Starts with a section title, it has 2 main paragraphs that describe the history of the company. Then it has a subtitle and a text that talks about the values of the company accompanied by a representative image aligned to the left, finally it has a second subtitle and a small text concluding the information and another image aligned to the right.

Consist of 4 sub-sections: one for activities and 3 different membership plans (Classic, Black and Classes only). Each of them is arranged in boxes, they have a title and a list of activities that make up the plan.

## Week 02
This week the work mode was individual. I started by reviewing the documentation and intensively reading the week planning.
Then progressively I was creating the HTML file, first making the basic structure and then adding the necessary components, always thinking about creating a semantic structure that facilitates accessibility and SEO. 
This landing page has a header, a side navigation bar, a main, and several content sections within it, also has a contact form and a footer.
The purpose is to start shaping the prototype of the landin page developed in week 01.
